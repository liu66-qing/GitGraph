"""Neo4j async client wrapper with per-event-loop connection pooling.

The driver is created lazily and cached PER EVENT LOOP. neo4j's async driver
binds its internal connection pool to the loop that created it, so a driver made
on the request loop cannot be used (or closed) from a background worker thread's
loop. Keying drivers by their running loop lets the single global `neo4j_client`
serve every loop safely — the API loop and any analysis worker each transparently
get (and only ever close) their own driver.
